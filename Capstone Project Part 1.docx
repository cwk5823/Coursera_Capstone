Existing Problem
Our clients, Coffee Express Ltd., is an SME specializing on serving coffee and beverages including Latte, Cappuccino, Espresso 
and hot chocolate at Downtown Vancouver in Canada. Recently, they approach to us and express their interests in expending their 
branches in a city of the worldâ€™s leading financial center in North America, in particular to either New York or Toronto. Both 
cities are the financial capitals with many skyscrapers and businessmen where the local demands of morning beverages remain high. 
However, it is difficult for Coffee Express Ltd. to make the decision on the best location for their expansion since they are not 
familiar with the demographics in both cities. 

Data Description
We can gather demographic data from the official census authorities about the population and income groups in both cities. 
After having comparison on the potential customer groups between New York and Toronto, we further explore the neighborhoods data 
from Foursquare API and apply Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering to prioritize the best coffee shop locations in either one 
of the cities based on the foot traffic and types of competitors. Finally, we can conclude the best city and location for Coffee 
Express Ltd. to start their expansion.

Deliverables
I.	Market analysis for Coffee Express Ltd.
II.	Top 10 locations suggested for expansion

Conclusion
The deliverables can help Coffee Express Ltd. to determine whether it is recommendable to expend their network at either New York 
or Toronto. If yes, we will further provide a list of suggestion about the top 10 locations for expansion.
